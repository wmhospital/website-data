    "question": "I have had COVID-19, do I still need to get the vaccine?",
    "answer": "<ul><li>According to the CDC – reinfection with COVID-19 is still possible.</li><li>The vaccine should be considered regardless of whether you already had the COVID-19 infection.</li></ul>"
  },
  {
    "question": "When will there be a vaccine for our kids?",
    "answer": "<ul><li>Several companies have begun enrolling children as young as age 12 in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials.</li><li>Studies including younger children will begin soon.</li><li>Currently the COVID-19 vaccine is only available to people age 16 and older.</li></ul>"
  },
  {
    "question": "Will the COVID-19 vaccination protect me from getting COVID?",
    "answer": "<ul><li>Yes - The COVID-19 vaccination works by teaching your immune system how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19, and this protects you from getting sick with COVID-19.</li></ul>"
  },
  {
    "question": "What type of side effects may occur and will they require me to miss work or have someone care for me?",
    "answer": "<ul><li>Most people experience mild side affects.</li><li>Your arm may be sore, red and warm to touch.</li><li>Others have reported headaches or fever. This is a sign that your immune system is working and building up protection to the disease.</li></ul>"
  },
  {
    "question": "Am I still a spreader if I have had COVID and/or if I have had my vaccine?",
    "answer": "<ul><li>Yes. - It takes several weeks to build up vaccine-induced antibodies and other immune defenses, and both vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna require a booster dose 21 to 28 days after the first dose. So, the full protection offered by the vaccines would take at least a month to develop.</li><li>And since the vaccines don’t work perfectly, and it’s not known yet to what extent they prevent infection, it’s possible that a vaccinated person might still get the virus and be able to pass it on to others.</li><li>People will still need to wear masks, socially distance, wash their hands and avoid large gatherings, especially indoors.</li><li>It will take time to vaccinate everyone. Until that happens and until it’s clear how well the vaccines prevent transmission, safety measures are still needed.</li></ul>"

  {
    "question": "Why do I still have to wear a mask after I am vaccinated?",
    "answer": "<ul><li>We can be immune and still be a carrier.</li></ul>"
