    },
    {
        "question": "Will the COVID-19 vaccination protect me from getting COVID?",
        "answer": "<ul><li>Yes - The COVID-19 vaccination works by teaching your immune system how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19, and this protects you from getting sick with COVID-19.</li></ul>"

    {
        "question": "Am I still a spreader if I have had COVID and/or if I have had my vaccine?",
        "answer": "<ul><li>Yes. - It takes several weeks to build up vaccine-induced antibodies and other immune defenses, and both vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna require a booster dose 21 to 28 days after the first dose. So, the full protection offered by the vaccines would take at least a month to develop.</li><li>And since the vaccines don’t work perfectly, and it’s not known yet to what extent they prevent infection, it’s possible that a vaccinated person might still get the virus and be able to pass it on to others.</li><li>People will still need to wear masks, socially distance, wash their hands and avoid large gatherings, especially indoors.</li><li>It will take time to vaccinate everyone. Until that happens and until it’s clear how well the vaccines prevent transmission, safety measures are still needed.</li></ul>"

    {
        "question": "How will we know how long our immunity last if we have had COVID-19?",
        "answer": "<ul><li>At this time, experts do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.</li><li>The immunity someone gains from having an infection, called natural immunity, varies from person to person. Some early evidence suggests natural immunity may not last very long.</li></ul>"
    },
    {
        "question": "With the new virus being more contagious, should I be wearing an N95 mask?",
        "answer": "<ul><li>The CDC is not recommending N95 masks.</li><li>N95s are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for health care workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by CDC.</li></ul>"
