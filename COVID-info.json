  {
    "question": "Will the COVID-19 vaccination protect me from getting COVID?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Am I still a spreader if I have had COVID and/or if I have had my vaccine?",
    "answer": "<ul><li>Yes. - It takes several weeks to build up vaccine-induced antibodies and other immune defenses, and both vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna require a booster dose 21 to 28 days after the first dose. So, the full protection offered by the vaccines would take at least a month to develop.</li><li>And since the vaccines don’t work perfectly, and it’s not known yet to what extent they prevent infection, it’s possible that a vaccinated person might still get the virus and be able to pass it on to others.</li><li>People will still need to wear masks, socially distance, wash their hands and avoid large gatherings, especially indoors.</li><li>It will take time to vaccinate everyone. Until that happens and until it’s clear how well the vaccines prevent transmission, safety measures are still needed.</li></ul>"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do I still have to wear a mask after I am vaccinated?",
    "answer": "<ul><li>We can be immune and still be a carrier.</li></ul>"
